          As with its immediate predecessor, <i>BEYONCÉ</i> (2013), it was
          released as both a surprise and a visual album; unlike <i>BEYONCÉ</i>,
          which featured individual music videos for each track, the
          <i>LEMONADE</i> visual album took the form of an hour-long film.

          The film version of <i>LEMONADE</i> premiered on American television
          network <i>HBO</i> on April 23, 2016. Beyoncé had previously teamed up
          with HBO to debut her 2013 documentary <i>Life Is But a Dream</i> and
          in 2014 to film her <i>On the Run Tour</i>. <i>LEMONADE</i> was
          promoted as a documentary style special in the same vein as
          <i>Life Is But a Dream</i>.
